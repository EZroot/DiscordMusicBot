# Discord Music Bot

A minimal, fast music bot. Clone, set your token, run.

No extra bullshit required.

## Features

-   **High-Quality Audio:** 
    
-   **Supports Youtube & Much More:** Play music from links or stream URLs.
    
-   **Fast Setup:** Just click `run.bat` and you're good.
    
### Prerequisites
Python only.

## Installation

### Step 1: Downloading the Bot
Open your terminal or command prompt:
 ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/EZroot/DiscordMusicBot.git
  ```

### Step 2: Configure Your Token

1.  Double-click **`run.bat`**.  It'll generate a **`config.ini`** file.
    
2.   Open the newly created **`config.ini`** file.
3. 
    Replace `PUT_YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE` with your Discord bot's secret token.   
    
**Optional**: Adjust `DEFAULT_VOLUME` or configure the `UseCookies` and `CookiesFile` settings if needed for accessing restricted content.

4. Rerun **`run.bat`** and your bot should appear in your server.


## Commands

All commands use Discord's native slash command feature (`/`).
